My name is Andres, but you can call me Andi :blush: Iâ€™m a certified Data Scientist with a keen interest in harassing the impact data can have in our daily lives. Iâ€™ve recently worked on a number of projects focused on Natural Language processing, Neural Networks and other supervised machine learning techniques. I have 7+ years experience with data analysis across various sectors including healthcare, non-profit, environmental, and government.

Iâ€™m a very curious person with a constant hunger for learning. My current skills include:

:sparkles: Python
:sparkles: Tableau
:sparkles: SQL, MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy
:sparkles: MongoDB, Non-relational Databases
:sparkles: Natural Language Processing
:sparkles: Neural Networks
:sparkles: Pandas, Numpy, Regular Expressions, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow, spaCy, PyTorch, Keras
:sparkles: Flask
:sparkles: Heroku
:sparkles: Docker
:sparkles: VS Code


Iâ€™m currently looking for opportunities where I can leverage my experience with Data Analysis with my machine learning knowledge to provide insight into meaningful and impactful client solutions.

When Iâ€™m not behind a screen, I love capturing the world through my camera, catching up with friends on hikes and discovering new artists. Feel free to reach out to me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andresvidaurre/) or [email](andresmvidaurre@gmail.com), Iâ€™d love to chat!
